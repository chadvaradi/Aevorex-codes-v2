# Frontend Long Files Audit (PHOENIX SYNC v5-R2 - P2-21)

Manual code review of files in `modules/shared/frontend/src` was performed
as automated line counting tools proved unreliable in the current environment.

**Result:** No files were identified as exceeding the 160 LOC limit
that would require an immediate split into `*.view.tsx` and `*.logic.ts`.

The longest and most complex files are the hooks (`useChatStream`, `useSearchData`),
but their current size is justified by their functionality.

This check will be automated in the CI pipeline as per the plan.
