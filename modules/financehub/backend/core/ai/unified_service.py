Unified AI Service (v1.0)

This service is the single, unified entry point for all AI-related operations,
including chat, analysis generation, and other future AI capabilities.

It orchestrates the new, modular components:
- prompt_engine: For classifying queries and building prompts.
- llm_gateway: For making robust, retry-enabled calls to LLM providers.
- AnalysisOrchestrator: For running the dedicated stock analysis pipeline.
