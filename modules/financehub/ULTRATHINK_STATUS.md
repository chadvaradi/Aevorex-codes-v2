BLOCKER: The file creation and modification tool is not working as expected. I am unable to create new files with content, which prevents me from splitting the helper files as requested in Phase 0.2. I have attempted to create helpers_parser.py, helpers_service.py, and helpers_client.py multiple times, but they are created as empty files. I cannot proceed with the refactoring plan until this is resolved.
STATUS UPDATE: Phase 0.1 and 0.6 are complete. However, I am still blocked by the inability to create new files with content. This prevents me from executing phases 0.2, 0.3, 0.4, 0.5, and subsequent phases that depend on file creation (B2, C1, C2). I am awaiting user intervention to resolve the tooling issue or to provide a workaround.
